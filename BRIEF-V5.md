# Website Brief v5: v2 Visual Style + v3 Content + New Services

## What happened
- v2 had the best visual design (hero dancer photo, navy/teal palette, sidebar nav, editorial feel)
- v3 had the right content direction (consultant-focused, outcome-framed)
- v4 (bento grid) was boring — going back to v2's visual approach

## Instructions
Restore v2's visual design language but with consultant-focused content. This means:

### Keep from v2's design
- Full-viewport hero with dancer photo (`assets/rik-dancer.jpg`), gradient overlay, text at bottom
- Navy dark palette: deep navy bg (#080c14 / #0c1220), teal accent (#38bdf8), warm amber (#f59e0b)
- Space Grotesk + IBM Plex Mono typography
- Sticky sidebar nav on desktop (rvd. logo, section links, social icons)
- Mobile hamburger menu with blur backdrop
- Scroll reveal animations (fade + translateY)
- Parallax on hero image
- Section dividers with subtle borders
- Card hover effects (lift + border brighten)
- Full-bleed images in cards (background images with gradient overlays, NOT small thumbnails)
- Photo credit "Kaka Lee" in corner of hero
- "Built at night, obviously." footer

### Change from v2: New consultant-focused content

#### Hero
- Keep: "Hi, I'm" + "Rik van Duijn" + dancer photo
- Change tagline to: "I help development teams ship better, faster, and with AI."
- Change chips to: `Mobile Expert` · `AI Integration` · `Team Enablement` · `Utrecht, NL`
- Add a subtle CTA: "See how →" that scrolls to first section

#### Section 1: What I Do (replace old "About")
Number: 01 — What I Do

Brief intro paragraph:
"I work with development teams who know they could be shipping faster. Whether it's introducing AI-powered workflows, levelling up mobile development practices, or building the automation that compliance demands — I embed with your team, set things up properly, and step back."

Then 4-5 service cards (use the full-bleed image style from v2 with gradient overlay text):

**Card 1: AI-Powered Development** (use `assets/section-code.png` as background)
Your developers are curious about AI but nobody's figured out how to use it productively. I've shipped production code with AI assistants daily for years. I'll introduce the right tools, establish quality gates, set up AI-powered code reviews and collaboration workflows, and get your team from experimenting to delivering.

**Card 2: Mobile Development** (use `assets/hero-mobile.png` as background)
7+ years of React Native across health tech, mobility platforms, and agency work. I audit app architectures, pair with your developers, and help teams build apps that genuinely work on both platforms. Not advice from the sideline — hands-on.

**Card 3: Automated Testing & Compliance** (use `assets/section-health.png` as background)
Fully automated testing pipelines. Regression testing, compatibility testing, deployment gates. For teams working under strict compliance and regulation demands, I build the workflow automation that gives you confidence every release meets the bar — without slowing you down.

**Card 4: CI/CD & Workflow Automation** (use `assets/section-creative.png` as background — or skip image on this one)
Build pipelines that work, code review culture that doesn't slow you down, shipping rhythms that stick. I set up the infrastructure and habits, then step back. No 200-page process documents — just things that work.

#### Section 2: Track Record (replace old "Career")
Number: 02 — Track Record

NOT a career timeline. Outcome-focused proof:

Three proof blocks (can be cards or clean text blocks):

1. **Health Tech Impact**
Built and maintained a cancer recovery app (Untire) used by thousands of patients fighting Cancer Related Fatigue. React Native, both platforms, real-world health outcomes.

2. **Mobility at Scale**
Developed the mobile platform for Reisbalans — travel reimbursement across the Netherlands. Complex domain, real users, production pressure.

3. **Full-Stack Agency Work**
4 years at Inspire Innovation building websites, web apps, and mobile apps for diverse clients. Where I learned to ship fast, handle curveballs, and care about craft.

Then a "Worked with" line:
Tired of Cancer · Reisbalans · Inspire Innovation

#### Section 3: Contact (replace old "Say Hello")
Number: 03 — Let's Talk

"Based in Utrecht. I work with teams who care about their craft. No formal proposals — just tell me what's going on and we'll figure out if I can help."

### What to remove entirely
- "About" section with personal story (game design origin, "first 80%" quote, stats)
- "Side Projects" section
- "Beyond Code" section (hobbies)
- "I'm not looking for a new gig" — the opposite, he IS available
- Doornroosje reference (doesn't work there)
- Career timeline format
- "88% goal achievement" stat

### Fixes from v2.1
- GitHub link: https://github.com/isilher (NOT rikvanduijn)
- Card images: full-bleed backgrounds with gradient text overlay (NOT small thumbnails)

### Section count
3 sections total (What I Do, Track Record, Let's Talk) + Hero + Footer. That's it. Clean, focused.
