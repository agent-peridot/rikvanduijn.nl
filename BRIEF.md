# Website Brief: rikvanduijn.nl

## Goal
Build a personal professional website for Rik van Duijn, inspired by his friend Gerard de Brieder's site (govannon.nl) but fitting Rik's personality, career, and aesthetic.

## Current site
rikvanduijn.nl is essentially empty — just a photo credit to Kaka Lee. Title "RvD".

## Reference: govannon.nl (Gerard de Brieder)
Gerard's site is a single-page professional portfolio with:
- Bold headline: "Your technology. My problem to fix."
- Subtitle: "Fractional CTO · Platform Architect"
- About section with personality — starts from Commodore 64 childhood, tells a story
- "How I work" section with 4 service cards (Fractional CTO, Platform & Infrastructure, Team & Process, AI Transition)
- Track record with timeline of roles and projects
- Each role has tech tags (Ruby/Rails, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Testimonial quote
- Direct, confident, slightly provocative tone ("If you need someone who colors inside the lines, I'm not your guy")
- Clean, modern design with sections, good typography

## Who Rik is (from my knowledge + Claude Code insights + LinkedIn)

### Professional
- **Current role:** Lead Mobile App Developer at Tired of Cancer (Untire app — cancer recovery support)
- **Previous:** Louwman (4 years), likely automotive/tech
- **Skills (from Claude Code insights):**
  - React Native mobile development (iOS + Android)
  - Python (TTS pipelines, tooling)
  - GitHub Actions / CI/CD automation
  - AWS / CloudWatch / infrastructure
  - TypeScript, Elixir knowledge (from his circles)
  - AI-assisted development — power user, built TTS systems with Claude
  - Game design background (studied design for virtual theater and games)
- **Style:** "Domain-expert driver who delegates aggressively but intervenes decisively with strong technical judgment"
- **Claude Code stats:** 509 messages, 51 sessions, 88% goal achievement, 58 commits in a month
- **Open source:** Built Voicify/Parkiet (TTS pipeline), OpenClaw contributor/power user

### Personal (use tastefully, not all of it)
- Based in Utrecht, Netherlands
- Renovating a house with partner Fija
- Runs TPK Tuesdays (tabletop RPG campaign)
- Music lover (works side gig at Doornroosje venue)
- Night owl, builder, explorer of the first 80%

### Personality & Tone
- NOT corporate, NOT boastful
- Warm but grounded, curious, precise, occasionally dry
- Solves problems in his head first, then builds
- Loves the exploration phase — the "first 80%"
- Values friendships, quality time
- Direct but not aggressive (contrast with Gerard's more provocative style)
- More "builder who cares about the craft" than "Viking CTO who breaks things"

## Design Direction
- Inspired by govannon.nl structure (single page, sections, clean)
- But warmer, less "corporate warrior" — more "craftsman who happens to be really good"
- Dark theme would fit (night owl)
- Could incorporate subtle game design / creative elements
- Tech-forward but human
- Mobile-first (he's a mobile developer after all!)

## Sections (suggested)
1. Hero — name, role, one-liner that captures his essence
2. About — the story, from game design student to mobile lead to AI tinkerer
3. What I do — current work, skills, approach
4. Projects / Track record — Untire, Voicify, OpenClaw experiments, etc.
5. Contact — simple, maybe LinkedIn + GitHub

## Tech Stack
- Static HTML/CSS/JS (single page, no framework needed)
- Clean, deployable anywhere
- Responsive / mobile-first

## Files
- `index.html` — the full site
- `styles.css` — styling
- Any assets in `assets/`
